# Description : Here 14 problems related to Data Science and Machine learning was       #
# 		          assigned to us with a given dataset "Loan_prediction" where it was      #
#		            devided into 2 parts training ("Loan_training.csv") and testing         #
#		            ("Loan_testing.csv"). problem file name "Lab_manual_Data_Science.pdf"   #
#		            here this data set represents bank loan approval activity according     #
#		            to the previous history of clients who took loan from the bank .        #
# 		          Basically we predicted whether a certain client should be approved      #
# 		          or not for his/her loan application to the bank , according to	        #
#		            certain details about them.					                                    #
#		            I applied different data preprocessing methods for cleaning the data    #
#		            and then different machine learning algorithmic models were applied     #
#		            to predict the desired output.					                                #

# Result : I Observed that the maximum out of sample accuracy to predict the approval   #
#	         found with "Decision Tree" classifier with tree height = 8 		              #	   
#	         last achieved accuracy for the given dataset : 77.53 %		                    #

# NB: i.  please view two image files to see what is happenning with the Decession tree #
#     ii. Install required libraries that is used in side the program code using        #
#         $ pip install python-PackageName					                                    #
#     iii. execute the "MultiVariate_Linear_regression.py" file using python3 to see    #
#     the 3D plot of multivariate linear regression for better visualization experience #
